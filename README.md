Iris Flower Classifier
This project uses machine learning to identify the species of an Iris flower based on its physical features.

I trained a Logistic Regression model on the Iris dataset, which predicts if a flower is Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

You’ll also find some basic data visualization in the project to understand the dataset better.

I added an optional Streamlit app so anyone can try predicting flower species with a simple web interface.

If you want to run it yourself, just install the required packages from requirements.txt and run streamlit run app.py.
